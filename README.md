# Clicks for Fics
### Overview
The Clicks for Fics project analyzes and visualizes the most popular fan fiction works and fandoms on the Archive of Our Own platform. It provides insights into the most common themes, characters, and relationships found in these works. The results are displayed through interactive data visualizations that showcase the diversity and creativity of the fan fiction community.

### Project Structure
The project consists of several main files, each serving a specific purpose:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the webpage.
- `main.js`: The main JavaScript file that controls the logic and interactions of the page.
- `relationships.js`: Contains the logic for displaying the relationship networks between characters.
- `tags.js`: Contains the logic for displaying additional tags and their categories.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the appearance and layout of the page.
Files and Their Functions

#### `index.html`
This file defines the basic structure of the webpage. It includes links to the CSS and JavaScript files and sets up the different sections of the page.

#### `main.js`
This script controls the main logic and interactions of the page. It loads the data, initializes the visualizations, and handles user interactions such as switching between different visualizations and displaying popups.

#### `relationships.js`
This script processes the relationship data between characters and displays it as an interactive network. Characters are represented as nodes, and their relationships are connections between these nodes. The network can be filtered by different relationship types (romantic, friendship).

#### `tags.js`
This script processes the additional tags associated with fan fiction works and displays them in a scrolling view. The tags are organized by categories, and the frequency of the tags is represented by font size.

#### `style.css`
This file contains the CSS rules that define the appearance and layout of the page. Special fonts, colors, and layouts are used to make the visualizations appealing.

### Interactive Elements
`Relationship Visualization`: Displays the networks of character relationships. Users can switch between different fandoms and change the relationship types.
`Tags Visualization`: Displays the most common tags and their categories. Users can switch between different fandoms and explore the tags.
